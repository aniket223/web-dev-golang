### <br> 

In this project, I have simply created a login, log out, and signup mechanism on
a using golang.

I have used a minimal database which is dbUsers and dbSession, these are just
simple maps.

We are using sessions, timeouts, handler interfaces, redirects, and cookies.

We are using satori and bcrypt packages in the along with other standard golang
packages.

In this project, I have not used a good U.I as I am simply using go to design
basic backend.
